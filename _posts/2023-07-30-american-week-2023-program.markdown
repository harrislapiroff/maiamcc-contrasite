What a delight to attend [American Week 2023](https://camp.cdss.org/camp-weeks/american-dance-music-week-2/) at Pinewoods Camp. I was there on a _callership_ (which is how I've decided to refer to my _caller scholarship_), doing maybe 25% of the calling for the week so that Will Mentor and Lisa Greenleaf had some space to breathe. I got to call some Challenging Contra sessions and some chunks of the evening dance, and also got to do a whole lot more dancing than I usually do when I'm on staff, which was honestly great. Also, I premiered a handful of new dances (marked here with a star). Here's what I called this week!<!-- more -->
