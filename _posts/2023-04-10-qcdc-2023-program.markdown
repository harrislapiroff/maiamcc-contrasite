Y'all, [Queer Contra Dance Camp](https://www.queercontradance.org/queercamp.html) on the West Coast is SO EXCELLENT. A weekend of contra and queer joy among the redwoods—what a delight to call for these folks. I shared the calling with incomparable Chris Ricciotti, and got to work with some red-hot musicians: The Mean Lids, and Aaron Marcus / Emily Troll / Anna Patton.

I taught a workshop on waltz ("Stone Soup: Waltzing with What You've Got"), and one on holding contra lines together ("Contra Superglue"), and called a bunch of contras. Here are my programs:<!-- more -->
