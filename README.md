# Maia's Contradance Site

Made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Deployed via [Cloudbuild](./cloudbuild), just push changes to GitHub (no need to `jekyll build`) and it should automatically work.

To preview: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

### TODO
[] choreo: mark new dances?
[] choreo: describe difficulty levels
[] choreo: filter by difficulty level, favorite, etc.?
[] choreo: custom dance title slugification can be one custom function, instead of multiple filters
[] blog: sidebar with recent posts? (look at formatting in partials/sidebar.scss, which currently isn't imported)
[] blog: collapsible choreo elems (see https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp) or tooltips (see https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/)
