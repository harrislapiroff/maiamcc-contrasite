choreo to-do:
  - use YAML to store my dances instead of awkward JS??
blog to-do:
  - post-specific description texts to show up on fb previews etc.
  - collapsible choreo elements - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp
  - sidebar with recent posts? (look at formatting in partials/sidebar.scss, which currently isn't imported)
