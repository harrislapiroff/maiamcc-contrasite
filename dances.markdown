As a choreographer, I strive to write dances that are both compelling and idiomatic--the coolest dance in the world isn't worth anything if it doesn't flow well enough for people to get the hang of it.

Here are a handful of dances that I've written, with more always on the way. I know at least a few of these have made it into others' collections, and been called as far afield as California and Alaska, so that's pretty cool! Feedback is always welcome (as are requests!)--feel free to [drop me a line](/contact.html).

Dances marked with an asterisk (`*`) are particular favorites/frequently called by others.

<!-- TODO: style this better (and maybe have toggles/filters?!)
A note on dance difficulties:

* `accessible`: interesting and enjoyable for experienced dancers, but accessible for beginners, hard to mess up
* `advanced`: a little trickier, better suited to later in the evening or more experienced halls
* `expert`: you should probably only call these to a very experienced hall or at an advanced dance
